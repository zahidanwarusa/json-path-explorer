Subject: Request for Flexibility in Weekly Office Attendance

Dear [Manager’s Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to bring to your attention a personal challenge I’m currently navigating and kindly request your support.

My daily commute to the office is 47 miles, which, combined with my family responsibilities, has become particularly challenging. I have a child with a disability who requires my presence at home until my wife returns from dropping off our other children at school. This timing sometimes conflicts with my ability to maintain a consistent weekly office schedule.

I deeply value my role and remain committed to delivering my responsibilities effectively. I kindly request if it would be possible to adjust my requirement for weekly in-office attendance to better balance my family obligations while continuing to contribute fully to my work.

I understand this decision rests with higher management, and I would greatly appreciate your assistance in forwarding this request on my behalf. I am happy to discuss this further if needed.

Thank you for your understanding and consideration.

Best regards,
Zahid

Let me know if you’d like any adjustments!
